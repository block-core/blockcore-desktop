## ðŸ’¿ Installation

You'll find the latest releases on the [releases](https://github.com/block-core/blockcore-wallet/releases) tab. Make sure you pick the latest release.

### Auto Updates

Blockcore Wallet have built in support for updates. They are not installed automatically, but you as
a user are in control. On each startup, Blockcore Wallet will check for a new version. Additionally if
you have been running Blockcore Walletfor a long time, you can perform a manual update check in the menu.

When an update is available, there will appear an icon on the menu. Click this icon, to see
update information and perform a download and installation.

### Windows

For Windows, we decided to only support 64-bit installations of Windows. If you are running
a 32-bit installation, please let us know by reporting an issue to survey the market demand.

Simply download the latest win-x64.exe file from the [releases](https://github.com/block-core/blockcore-wallet/releases) page and run
the installer. You might need to approve installation of unsigned installer. This will only
be required until we have a signed release available.

### Linux

For Linux, we decided to use the new AppImage installer format. This is included in a lot of
Linux distributions, including Ubuntu.

Download the latest linux-x86_64.AppImage from the [releases](https://github.com/block-core/blockcore-wallet/releases) page.

Open a terminal, navigate to the download folder and make the .AppImage an executeable with 
the following command:

```
$ chmod a+x Blockcore.*.AppImage
```

Then you can simply run the installer:

```
$ ./Blockcore.*.AppImage
```

### Mac


## Mobile (Android/iOS)

Support for running Blockcore Wallet on mobile devices is currently under development. To build and run the mobile version, you need to do the following.


### Development environment

Make sure you have Node.JS install, and open a console promt and navigate to the root of the repo.

```sh
# Install the packages if you have not yet.
npm install
```

### Install tooling
```sh
# Run the script that will install tooling and add platforms. It installs Cordova globally, and add support for android, ios and browser.
npm run mobile-setup
```

### Build to mobile

Normally the "npm start" will build to the dist folder and launch Electron on the desktop. For mobile running, we do currently not have an auto-reload 
development setup. It's a manual build and run.

```sh
# This will build the Angular code and output to the mobile/www folder.
npm run mobile-build

# This will launch the web browser, or you can use "mobile-android" or "mobile-ios".
npm run mobile-browser
```
